title: Welcome New Fish--Rhodeus Cyanorostris
summary: I had hoped to own these small fish for several months, but it is endangered, so I didn't buy it. It was a few weeks before my birthday, my friends' company started to sell the artificial breeding individuals, and my best friend bought some for me. What a BIRTHDAY SURPRISE!!!!

## About Rhodeus Cyanorostris
### History
As an native fish enthusiast, I would like to tell a small story before showing my fish.

A few years ago, when _Rhodeus cyanorostris_ was discovered, many people were attracted by its beautiful color. However, as an endemic species, due to overfishing, its population dropped rapidly, and was about to extinct.

This is what happened to many native ornamental fish, but _Rhodeus cyanorostris_ is lucky. It met someone to save it.

At such moment, some of my friends tried to save this cute tiny fish. They collect the fish from other keepers, some helpful fish merchants, and another new site. After three or four years breeding, during which their initial release site was discovered by some people and destroyed, they finally prepared enough fish and released them in three different sites, and successfully established stable population.

Now, they established a business HECHUAN Native, engaging on the artificial breeding of native ornamental fish like bitterlings. It is also where I bought mine from.

### Introduction
The Chinese name of _Rhodeus cyanorostris_ means "bitterlings with blue snout". Actually other than bright blue snout, _Rhodeus cyanorostris_ also has a cyan back, a blue abdomen, dark blue lateral line scales, and blue or orange fins. You can see it in my photos.

Then I carefully did the water exchange, allowed them to acclimate the new environment.

After 1.5 hours of their arrival, I added them to my tank.

Then a few days later, after they displayed their beautiful coloration, I took these photos.

The left one is more clear, and you can see the bright blue snout, from which this fish got its name. The right figure, though not really clear, shows you the cyan color on their back.
