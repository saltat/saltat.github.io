I'm an enthusiast on biotope aquarium and China's native fish, especially bitterlings (Acheilognathinae)
I enjoy breeding fish on my own and have bred more than 200 bitterlings in 2025 spring breeding season
Being as an enthusiast on native fish, I would really like to post something on the internet to let more people knowing the beautiful fish in China's rivers and lakes
Being awareness of the survival of native fish in the wild, whose population has been destroyed by overfishing and habitat losing, I hope to get more attention on these small fish, and call on the protection on them.
As and native fish enthusiast, I appreciate the thought of selling artificial breeding bitterlings on the market to replace wild ones, and hope there would be more people accept them
In this blog, I will share my daily on the aquarium tanks in my home, and my fish
Sometimes I will also post guidance on how to breed bitterlings in your home, hope you would like it
